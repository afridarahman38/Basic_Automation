# Web Automation Testing with Selenium

## Project Overview
This project focuses on web automation testing using Selenium, a powerful tool for automating web browsers. The tests are conducted using Java as the primary programming language, along with WebDriverManager for managing browser drivers and TestNG for test execution and reporting. Various aspects of web automation testing are covered, including:

- TestNG Integration: Leveraging TestNG for organizing and executing test cases, as well as generating detailed test reports.

- Locating Web Elements: Using different methods to locate web elements such as IDs, class names, XPaths, and CSS selectors.

- Interacting with Web Elements: Automating interactions with web elements such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and submitting data.

- Browser Commands: Controlling browser behavior, including opening and closing browser instances, maximizing windows, and navigating backward and forward.

- Navigating Through Web Pages: Navigating through different web pages by clicking links, navigating back and forward, and refreshing pages.

- Handling Alerts and Pop-ups: Managing alerts and pop-ups that appear during the testing process, such as confirmation dialogs and JavaScript alerts.

- Action & Select Class: Performing advanced interactions with web elements using the Actions class for mouse hover, drag and drop, and the Select class for handling dropdowns.

- Assertions: Using assertions to validate expected outcomes and ensure the correctness of test results.

- Handling Frames: Switching between frames within a web page and interacting with elements inside frames.

- Working with Windows and Tabs: Handling multiple windows and tabs, switching between them, and closing unwanted windows.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Selenium: Selenium WebDriver is used as the core automation tool for web browser automation.

- Java: Java programming language is used for writing test scripts and interacting with Selenium WebDriver.

- WebDriverManager: WebDriverManager is used for managing browser drivers and automating the setup process.

- TestNG: TestNG is used as the testing framework for organizing test cases, executing tests, and generating reports.

## How to Run Tests
- Setup Environment: Ensure that Java, WebDriverManager, TestNG, and Selenium WebDriver are installed and configured on your machine.

- Clone Repository: Clone the GitHub repository containing the project files to your local machine.

- Import Project: Import the project into your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ) as a Maven project.

- Configure Dependencies: Ensure that all necessary dependencies are resolved and available in the project's Maven configuration.

- Run Tests: Run the test suite using TestNG to execute the automated tests. TestNG will execute the test cases and generate detailed reports.

- Review Reports: Review the generated test reports to analyze test results, including passed, failed, and skipped tests, along with any associated logs or screenshots.
